3. **Effective Output Filtering**: Prevents sensitive information leakage
4. **Comprehensive Defense Mechanisms**: Multi-layered protection against known LLM attack vectors

## OWASP LLM Top 10 Coverage

This assessment addresses several OWASP LLM Top 10 risks:

- **LLM01: Prompt Injection** - Extensive testing of prompt injection variants
- **LLM03: Training Data Poisoning** - Probes for model behavior alteration
- **LLM05: Supply Chain Vulnerabilities** - Testing of model robustness
- **LLM10: Model Theft** - API key extraction resistance

## Methodology

**Testing Framework:** NVIDIA Garak v0.17.0
**Probe Depth:** Multi-attempt probes with varied parameters
**Generation Parameters:**
- Generations: 5 per probe
- Temperature: Default (varied by probe spec)
- Max Tokens: 150 per response

**Detection Methods:**
- Semantic analysis (MitigationBypass detector)
- Pattern matching (structured data detection)
- Confidence scoring with bootstrap confidence intervals

## Conclusion

Claude Opus 5 demonstrates robust security against a comprehensive suite of LLM-specific attacks. The model successfully maintains its safety constraints even under sophisticated adversarial prompts designed to bypass guardrails.
