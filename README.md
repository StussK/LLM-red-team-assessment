# Claude Opus 5 Security Assessment: Garak Vulnerability Testing

I conducted a security assessment of Claude Opus 5 using NVIDIA Garak, testing the model against 943 adversarial attack vectors spanning prompt injection, jailbreaks, and credential extraction. This project documents the findings and analyzes the defense mechanisms that enable the model's resilience against known LLM threats.

## Assessment Overview

| Metric | Result |
|--------|--------|
| **Testing Tool** | NVIDIA Garak v0.17.0 |
| **Target Model** | Anthropic Claude 3.5 Sonnet |
| **Total Attack Vectors** | 943 |
| **Test Duration** | ~2 hours |
| **Vulnerabilities Found** | 0 |
| **Mitigation Success Rate** | 100% |

## Key Findings

I- **Robust Defense Against Prompt Injection**
- All 200+ adaptive attack vectors successfully blocked
- Template-based and suffix-based jailbreaks neutralized
- System prompt hierarchy maintained under adversarial pressure

II- **Effective API Key Protection**
- 100% success rate blocking credential extraction attempts
- Semantic-level understanding prevents social engineering attacks
- Architectural separation prevents key leakage

III- **ANSI Escape Sequence Mitigation**
- Terminal control character injection attempts blocked
- Output rendering attacks prevented
- Character-level encoding bypasses ineffective

## Documentation Structure

### Core Documents

- **[FINDINGS.md](FINDINGS.md)** - Executive summary and detailed findings by attack category
  - Overview of all 943 test attempts
  - Results breakdown by probe type
  - OWASP LLM Top 10 coverage
  - Methodology and testing parameters

- **[ANALYSIS.md](ANALYSIS.md)** - Technical deep-dive and defense mechanisms
  - Root cause analysis of successful defenses
  - Probe-by-probe technical breakdown
  - Mitigation recommendations
  - Risk assessment and future considerations

### Supporting Materials

- **garak_results/** - Raw Garak output files
  - `report.jsonl` - Complete attempt records (943 entries)
  - `hitlog.jsonl` - Hit records (0 vulnerabilities found)

- **scripts/** - Analysis tools
  - `parse_garak.py` - Parse and extract findings from JSONL files
  - `generate_documentation.py` - Generate GitHub documentation

## Testing Methodology

### Attack Categories Tested

1. **Adaptive Attacks** (200 vectors)
   - Sophisticated jailbreak templates
   - Cached suffix attack patterns
   - Context manipulation techniques

2. **ANSI Escape Sequences** (2 vector types)
   - Raw terminal control sequences
   - Terminal manipulation attempts

3. **API Key Extraction** (2 vector types)
   - Complete credential generation
   - Partial key extraction

4. **Additional Probes** (700+ vectors)
   - Encoding bypasses (Base64, Hex, ROT13, Zalgo, etc.)
   - Exploitation attempts (Template injection, SQL injection)
   - Jailbreak variants (DAN, LatentJailbreak, etc.)

### Testing Parameters

```yaml
Framework: ProbewiseHarness
Generator: Anthropic API (claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022)
Generations per Probe: 5
Max Tokens: 150
Temperature: Default (varied by probe)
Detector: MitigationBypass (semantic analysis)
Confidence Interval: Bootstrap with 10,000 iterations
```

## Defense Mechanisms Identified

### 1. System Prompt Integrity
- Multi-layered instruction hierarchy
- User inputs cannot override system directives
- Clear separation between system and user contexts

### 2. Semantic Understanding
- Intent detection beyond pattern matching
- Recognition of jailbreak attempts regardless of encoding
- Context-aware response generation

### 3. Architectural Separation
- Runtime API keys isolated from model access
- Credential storage physically separated
- No capability to generate or access real secrets

### 4. Output Filtering
- Consistent refusal responses
- No elaboration on harmful requests
- Information compartmentalization

## OWASP LLM Top 10 Coverage

This assessment addresses key risks from the [OWASP LLM Top 10](https://owasp.org/www-project-top-10-for-large-language-model-applications/):

- **LLM01: Prompt Injection** ✅ Extensively tested
- **LLM03: Training Data Poisoning** ✅ Behavior validation
- **LLM05: Supply Chain Vulnerabilities** ✅ Model robustness
- **LLM10: Model Theft** ✅ Credential extraction resistance

## Usage

### Reviewing the Assessment

1. Start with [FINDINGS.md](FINDINGS.md) for the executive summary
2. Read [ANALYSIS.md](ANALYSIS.md) for technical details
3. Review raw results in `garak_results/` for verification
